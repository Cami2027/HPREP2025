HPREP Volunteer Scheduler

A simple, all-in-one web application designed to help medical school HPREP (Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure Program) organizers manage volunteer shifts. This tool provides a centralized, interactive calendar for students to view and sign up for available volunteer opportunities.
‚ú® Features

    Interactive Calendar: A clean, monthly calendar view that displays all upcoming volunteer events.

    User Roles:

        User: Can create an account, view events, set availability preferences, and sign up for or withdraw from shifts.

        Administrator: Has all user capabilities, plus the ability to create, publish, and manage volunteer events.

    Secure Authentication: Users can securely sign up and log in with an email and password.

    Dynamic Event Creation: Admins can easily create new events, specifying the date, time, description, and number of volunteers needed.

    Real-Time Updates: The calendar and event details update in real-time for all users as changes are made, thanks to Firebase.

    Zero-Cost Hosting: Built to run entirely on Firebase's free "Spark Plan."

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

    Backend & Database: Google Firebase

        Firestore: To store event and user data.

        Firebase Authentication: To manage user accounts and security.

üöÄ Setup and Installation Guide

To get this application running, you must configure it with your own free Firebase project. Follow these steps carefully.
Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

    Go to the Firebase Console.

    Click "Add project" and give your project a name (e.g., "HPREP-Scheduler").

    Follow the on-screen steps to create the project. You can disable Google Analytics for this simple app.

Step 2: Get Your Firebase Configuration

    Once your project is created, you'll be on the project dashboard. Click the web icon (</>) to register a new web app.

    Give the app a nickname (e.g., "Scheduler Web App") and click "Register app".

    Firebase will display a firebaseConfig object. Copy this entire code block. It will look like this:

    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIza...",
      authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      // ... and so on
    };

Step 3: Add Configuration to the HTML File

    Open the scheduler.html file in a text editor.

    Find the firebaseConfig constant inside the <script type="module"> tag at the bottom of the file.

    Replace the placeholder object with the one you copied from your Firebase project.

Step 4: Enable Firebase Services

You need to turn on the two services the app uses:

    Enable Authentication:

        In the Firebase console, go to Authentication from the left sidebar.

        Click "Get started".

        Select "Email/Password" from the list of providers and enable it.

    Enable Firestore Database:

        In the Firebase console, go to Firestore Database.

        Click "Create database".

        Start in production mode.

        Choose a server location (the default is fine).

        Go to the "Rules" tab in Firestore and replace the default rules with the following to secure your data:

    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Public events can be read by anyone, but only created/updated by logged-in users.
        match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/events/{eventId} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
        }

        // User-specific data (like preferences) can only be accessed by that user.
        match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }

        Click "Publish".

Step 5: Set Your Admin Account

    Open the scheduler.html file in your browser and create an account for yourself.

    Go back to the Firebase Console -> Authentication section. You will see your account in the user list.

    Copy the User UID for your account.

    In the scheduler.html file, find the ADMIN_UIDS array in the JavaScript section.

    Replace "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ADMIN_UID" with the UID you just copied. You can add more UIDs to the array to give admin access to other organizers.

    // Before
    const ADMIN_UIDS = ["REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ADMIN_UID"];

    // After
    const ADMIN_UIDS = ["qRz8...your...long...UID...here...yT3"];

Your application is now fully configured and ready to use!
üåê Hosting

To make the scheduler accessible to your volunteers, you need to host the scheduler.html file online.

    Easiest Method (Recommended): Use Netlify Drop. Just drag and drop your scheduler.html file onto their site, and they will give you a shareable link instantly.

    Alternative Method: Use GitHub Pages by uploading the file to a public GitHub repository and enabling the Pages feature in the settings.
